# Contributing

Fork the repo, follow the setup steps in the [README](README.md#setup), and create a branch for your change.

## Before opening a PR

Run `yarn clean` — this fixes lint and formatting issues and runs the type checker. Fix any errors it can't auto-resolve before submitting.

Try to keep commits focused. We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add session export to CSV
fix: correct autonomous score total
chore: update firebase dependency
```

## Bugs and feature requests

Open an issue. For bugs, include steps to reproduce and what you expected to happen. For features, a brief description of the problem you're trying to solve is enough to start a conversation.
